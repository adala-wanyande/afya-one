## About The App
This repository serves to store the React code for the frontend for the Afya One Project. Afya One is a health and fitness logger that I'm developing to assist me in my health and fitness journey starting in 2024. Without too much long talk, that's the gist of the app.

## Screenshots

## Technologies
